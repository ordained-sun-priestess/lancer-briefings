# Mission // #002
## On Strike

Civil unrest has been escalating throughout Hadii enough that a general strike has started in Mather and is picking up enough steam to fire up workers across the rest of the planet. This is good news, of course, but we have intel that Harrison Armory is planning to employ MSMC for a false flag operation. They intend to open fire on several groups of strikers and pin the blame on terrorists from the Karrakin Trade Baronies. 

# Goals
- Travel to Mather and defend the strikers.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, thousands of lives could be lost. Others across Hadii will likely feel disinclined to participate in a general strike.

# Reserves
- Anything you've gathered up so far.

# Confirmed OpFor
- Nothing concrete known at the present moment. It is likely you will be facing MSMC personnel for most of this.

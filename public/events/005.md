# Ukathe, Hadii //
* 0900 CrST // THRONEBREAKERS discuss their findings from individual expeditions and make a plan
* 0930 CrST // ThRONEBREAKERS meet with Elder Augur Proxima, who relates to them about his visions, directing them to investigate the drones. 
* 0957 CrST // THRONEBREAKERS investigate the closed off hot springs and find a wrecked drone with a strange program named UNGOLIANT Blackwash Guidance System
* 1007 CrST // After taking a look inside the drone nexus, the THRONEBREAKERS learn there has been an outside signal transmitting to the nexus from the wetlands to control the UNGOLIANT program. A feral balor attack is triggered after a response from the other side of the connection
* 1015 CrST // THRONEBREAKERS succesfully fight off the feral balors. Looking into the logs, the precise location of the point of origin can be found. Communication logs reveal they have an underground hideout with a sniper-spotter team overlooking the entrance 24/7. These are most likely the seven mysterious strangers ANOMALY learned of earlier.
